# Chatctron
Chatctron is a realtime ios chat application. Compared to traditional message app using socket.io, Chatctron is powered by [Google Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) (NOSQL database) and provides low-latency communication between clients. The app allows users to create accounts and login with their verified emails and passwords. After authentications are validated by firebase backend service, users can sync their message data with cloud database in real time.
